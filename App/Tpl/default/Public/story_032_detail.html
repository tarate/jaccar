											<br/><p>I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to spend 8 weeks on board Bourbon Trieste, a vessel operating for Total in Nigeria mainly in the AKPO field but also in the USAN field.</p><br/> 
											<p>My job was Shift Supervisor, which means that I was responsible for operations related to the vessel's offshore activities, marine operations being managed by the Captain and officers.</p><br/>
											<p>Bourbon Trieste is able to provide all of the following BOURBON services for its clients: </p><br/>
											<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vessel and crew: Bourbon Offshore Greenmar</p>
											<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operations Manager & Ship Manager: Bourbon Offshore Greenmar</p> 
											<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Offshore crew (deck foreman, riggers and shift supervisor): Bourbon Interoil Nigeria, Bourbon Offshore Greenmar and Bourbon Subsea Services</p>
											<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ROV (submarine robots) and pilots: Bourbon Offshore DNT</p>
											<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management and Engineering contracts: Bourbon Subsea Services</p>
											<p>I therefore spend Christmas and the New Year on board. This time of the year is often seen as an opportunity to assess the closing year, but it's also a time to forget past worries and start the forthcoming year in the best possible conditions.</p><br/>
											<p>On this particular occasion the cooks prepared some real feasts for us! It's worth pointing out how very important the part played by cooks is when you're on board ship, as the quality of meals directly affects mood, health and crew efficiency.</p><br/>
											<p>Despite the large number of subsidiaries (BO Greenmar, BO DNT, BINL and Bourbon Subsea Services) and nationalities working on board this vessel, it is quite remarkable to see how BOURBON manages to ensure high quality services thanks to the exemplary cooperation of all employees on board. This has resulted in operations over the past 2 years </p>
