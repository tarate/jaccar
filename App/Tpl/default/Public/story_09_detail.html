Oleg Kozlov is part of the Ukrainian settlement working for SAPMER, those men have a long experience of Toothfish fishing in the Kerguelen waters. Like most of his compatriots, Oleg is from Kerch, major port between the Black Sea and the Azov Sea. After starting in the North Sea, he decided to sail in the Southern seas in 1996, on board Ukrainian boats, before being recruited by SAPMER in 2000. He first worked on Croix du Sud, then on Ile Bourbon before joining the Albius crew, where he is now the second bosun. Between each of the three fishing trips, which last just under 90 days, Oleg remains on board with other foreign sailors. "There are some maintenance that need to be done while in dock, to board equipment prior to departure, but we have time to rest and take a walk around the island," he says.</p><br/>
											 <p>Aged 43, Oleg is married with one son. He is reunited with his family three months a year. Between the fishing trips, he communicates with his family by Skype. "There is wi-fi on the boat and everyone has his computer: no need to buy phone cards as before!". The work is hard in the cold TAAF waters, so far away from Kerch. "But in my family, everyone is a sailor, I cannot imagine my life away from the sea," says Oleg smiling.</p>
