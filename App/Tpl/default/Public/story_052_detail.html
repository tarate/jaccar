											<br/><p>In 2004, I returned to my home province of TraVinh, Vietnam to establish Mylan Group (then, Mylan Chemicals Inc.). With my experience as an entrepreneur and businessman in Canada, I dreamed of building a successful high tech company in one of the most rural and underdeveloped regions in the country. The challenges faced were the lack of infrastructure, absence of industry knowledge, and shortage of skilled labor. Yet, I saw immense potential in the local population with its abundance of energetic and hardworking people.</p><br/> 
											<p>When Mylan Group began operating in 2006, it consisted of one chemicals manufacturing plant and a dozen employees. We focused on supplying only a handful of products to customers in the offset printing industry. Even in those early days, we prioritized training our people in the hard and soft skills required to meet international standards.</p><br/>
											<p>In a short seven years, Mylan Group has expanded from a single plant to a globally competitive company with three subsidiaries serving the specialty chemicals, electronics, and printing and packaging markets. Our team has grown from a dozen to over 350 dedicated employees. Among them are innovative engineers, chemists, and technicians who helped launch new products and became named inventors on patented technology.</p><br/>
											<p>By investing in TraVinh’s most valuable resource, I was able to capture a significant business opportunity with Mylan Group. The company has since made a positive impact on both the industries and communities in which we operate. Mylan Group’s team and our culture of innovation and quality, transparency, social responsibility, and sustainability will allow the business to continue excelling for years to come.</p>
