											<p>Undoubtedly one of the best showrooms in the group</p>

											<br/><p>IThis is how the President of the Board of Directors of VM Matériaux described the new premises during one of his visits to our island.  VM Matériaux is a leading group in its field and is listed on the Paris stock exchange.  It was Alain Beuret, manager of SOREPRO (same group) who hinted at that description.  Although he is proud of his new showroom at La Mare in Sainte Marie, this self-made man prefers working discreetly but efficiently and is obsessed with the desire to satisfy his customers.</p><br/> 
											<p>His clientele apparently really likes this new sales area in which the VM Matériaux group (and their three companies, BP Services, VM and Sorepro) have settled since January 2010.  Both professionals and individual buyers come to this strategically-based location.  The project, which was handled by CBo Territoria, is entirely custom-built.  “Initially the plot seemed rather too small, but the plans proposed by CBo, who completely took our requirements on board, enabled us to have the showroom and store on the same site.  The buildings are well thought-out and totally efficient”, says Alain Beuret.</p><br/>
											<p>The group, which is also present in Le Port and St Pierre, makes a showcase of its new address in La Mare with its surprising design, created by the architects of Quadra.
“People expect good products and good advice, and that’s our job, but they also expect to have easy access and plenty of parking space, and on that score they are fully satisfied” declared the entrepreneur.</p><br/>
											<p>At Sainte Marie, the La Mare roundabout, the end of the runway at the airport of Gillot, even when you are taking off in a large plane, you can’t miss the new premises of VM Matériaux.</p>
