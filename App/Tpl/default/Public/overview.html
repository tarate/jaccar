									<p style="margin-top:20px;">In 1980, JACCAR was solely involved in Bourbon. We were essentially a sugar producer in Reunion Island, converting traditional farming and small factories into a modernized leader of sugar production by 1990.</p>
									<p  style="margin-top:20px;">The building of a conglomerate of 3 businesses followed: sugar, food, retail and the development of marine activities â€“ all culminating into the listed company it came to be in 1998.</p>
									<p  style="margin-top:20px;">Simultaneously, our portfolio forged new ground within the stock market of the day. In 2001, we identified a greater potential for growth by focusing on marine services, particularly in the oil and offshore industry. This meant choosing JACCAR as the vehicle for growth by building a new diversified portfolio from the strong base of Bourbon.</p>
									<p  style="margin-top:20px;">In 2003, our diversification accelerated into shipbuilding in China and France, into fishing and real estate as well as into emerging market investments, mainly in Vietnam and China.</p>
									<p style="font-style: italic; margin-top:20px; color:#333333;padding-bottom:82px;">
Within 30 years, our measurable successes have culminated into a diversified portfolio of businesses with a net asset value of over one billion euros. </p>
